## 🤷 What is clean-mac?

**clean-mac** is your Mac’s unofficial janitor — the one that actually shows up. 
With a single command, it scrubs away system and user junk: caches, logs, temporary 
clutter, dusty old downloads, and whatever’s been rotting in your Trash. It even cleans 
up after Homebrew’s bad habits (because who else will?). At the end, it smugly tells you 
how much space it saved — and logs every step, just in case you want receipts.
