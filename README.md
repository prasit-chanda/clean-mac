## 🤷 Why clean-mac?

**🫧 clean-mac.run** politely barges into your Mac, checks if it has the tools to do its 
job (and installs them if you’ve been slacking), then proceeds to clean up your digital 
dumpster — clearing caches, logs, temp files, Trash, Xcode junk, ancient iOS backups, 
Docker leftovers, and even those decade-old Downloads you forgot about. It frees up 
memory, shows off your system info like a flex, logs every step so you can pretend 
you planned this all along, and wraps things up by safely exiting like the responsible 
little automation it is. All that, with zero cost and maximum attitude.
